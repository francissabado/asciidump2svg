# ASCII Dump to SVG

This project is a branch of the Matthew Beckler's [project](http://www.mbeckler.org/cadence_plot/). The tool can be used with Cadence Virtuoso 5.1 by exporting an ascii dump file as it demonstrates or by generating the asciidump with from a any gds file (e.g exported by Virtuoso 6.1) generated by [gds2ascii](https://github.com/leoheck/gds2ascii). The script requires a configuration file to map layers. The default option is the FreeDPK 45 nm but it can be extended to any design kit.

Required tools
- python
- inkscape

Execution
```bash
asciidump2svg CELL_NAME GDS_FILE
```
